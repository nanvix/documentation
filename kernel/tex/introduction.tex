	% About Nanvix.
	Nanvix is an operating system created by Pedro H. Penna for
	educational purposes. It was designed from scratch to be small and
	simple, and yet modern and fully featured, so that it could help
	enthusiasts in operating systems, to learn about kernel hacking. The
	first release of Nanvix came out in early 2011, and since then the
	system has undergone through several changes. This paper details the
	internals of Nanvix 1.2.  All previous and future releases are
	available at \url{github.com/ppenna/nanvix}, under the GPLv3
	license.

	% Paper organization.
	In this section, we present an overview of Nanvix, starting with the
	system architecture, then presenting the system services, and
	finally discussing the required hardware to run the system. In later
	sections, we present a more detailed description of Nanvix.

	\subsection{System Architecture}
	\label{section: system architecture}

		% Nanvix and System V.
		The architecture of Nanvix is outlined in Figure \ref{figure:
		nanvix architecture}. It presents a similar structure to Unix
		System V, and it has been intentionally designed to be so due to
		two main reasons.  First, some successful operating systems,
		such as Aix, Linux and Solaris, are based on this architecture.
		Second, System V has earned Dennis Ritchie and Kenneth Thompson
		the 1983 Turing Award. These points indicate that System V is a
		well-structured system, thus serving as a good baseline design
		for a new educational operating system, such as Nanvix.

		% Architecture overview.
		Nanvix is structured in two layers. The kernel, the bottom
		layer, seats on top of the hardware and runs in privileged mode,
		with full access to all resources. Its job is to extended the
		underlying hardware so that: (i) a more pleasant interface,
		which is easier to program, is exported to the higher layer; and
		(ii) resources can be shared among users, fairly and
		concurrently. The userland, the top layer, is where user
		software run in unprivileged mode, with limited access to the
		hardware, and the place where the user itself interacts with the
		system.

		% Kernel architecture.
		The kernel presents a monolithic architecture, and it is
		structured in four subsystems: the hardware abstraction layer;
		the memory management system; the process management system; and
		the file system. The hardware abstraction layer interacts
		directly with the hardware and exports to the other subsystems a
		set of well defined low-level routines, such as those for
		dealing with IO devices, context switching and interrupt
		handling. Its job is to isolate, as much as possible, all the
		hardware intricacies, so that the kernel can be easily ported to
		other compatible platforms, by simply replacing the hardware
		abstraction layer.

		architecture} \end{figure}

		% Memory management system.
		The memory management subsystem provides a flat virtual memory
		abstraction to the system. It does so by having two modules
		working together: the swapping and virtual memory modules. The
		swapping module deals with paging, keeping in memory those pages
		that are more frequently used and swapping out to disk those
		that are not.  The virtual memory system, on the other hand,
		relies on the paging module to manage higher-level abstractions
		called memory regions, and thus enable advanced features such as
		shared memory regions, on-demand loading, lazy coping and memory
		pinning.

		% Process management system.
		The process management system handles creation, termination,
		scheduling, synchronization and communication of processes.
		Processes are single thread entities and are created on demand,
		either by the system itself or the user. Scheduling is based on
		preemption and happens in userland whenever a process runs out
		of quantum or blocks awaiting for a resource. In kernel land, on
		the other hand, processes run in nonpreemptive mode and
		scheduling occurs only when a processes voluntarily relinquishes
		the processor.  Additionally, the process management subsystem
		exports several routines that allow processes to synchronize
		their activities and communicate with one another.

		% File system.
		The file system provides a uniform interface for dealing with
		resources. It extends the device driver interface and creates on
		top of it the file abstraction. Files can be accessed through a
		unique pathname, and may be shared among several processes
		transparently.  The Nanvix file system is compatible with the
		one present in the Minix 1 operating system, it adopts an
		hierarchical inode structure, and supports mounting points and
		disk block caching.

		% Userland.
		The userland relies on the system calls exported by the kernel.
		User libraries wrap around some of these calls to provide
		interfaces that are even more friendly to programmers. Nanvix
		offers great support to the Standard C Library and much of the
		current development effort is focused on enhancing it. User
		programs are, ultimately, the way in which the user itself
		interacts with the system. Nanvix is shipped out with the Tiny
		Shell (\texttt{tsh}) and the Nanvix Utilities
		(\texttt{nanvix-util}), which heavily resemble traditional Unix
		utilities. 

	\subsection{System Services}
	\label{section: system services}

		% System calls overview.
		The main job of the kernel is to extend the underlying hardware and
		offer the userland a set of services that are easier to deal with,
		than those provided by the bare machine. These services are indeed
		exported as system calls, which user applications invoke just as
		normal functions and procedures. Nanvix implements 45 system calls,
		being the majority of them derived from the Posix 1 specification
		\cite{IEEE:08}. The most relevant system calls that are present in
		Nanvix are listed in Table \ref{table: most relevant system calls in
		nanvix} and briefly discussed in the paragraphs that follow. For
		further information about all system calls in Nanvix, refer to the
		system man pages.

		% File system system calls: manipulating files.
		Files are high-level abstractions created for modeling resources,
		being primarily designed and used to provide a natural way to
		manipulate disks. One program that wants to manipulate a file shall
		first open it by calling \texttt{open()}. Then, it may call
		\texttt{read()} and/or \texttt{write()} to read and/or write data to
		the file. If the file supports random access, the read/write file
		offset may be moved through the \texttt{lseek()} system call.
		Finally, when the program is done with that file, it may explicitly
		close it by calling \texttt{close()}, and have its contents flushed
		to the underlying device.

		% File system system calls: manipulating the file system.
		The file system is organized hierarchically, in a tree-like
		structure, and files are uniquely identified by their pathnames. A
		program may refer to a file either by using an absolute pathname,
		which starts in the root directory; or by using a relative pathname
		to the current working directory of the program. Programs may change
		their current working directory by invoking \texttt{chdir()}.
		Alternatively, users can create links to files by calling
		\texttt{link()}, and then refer to the linked file by referring to
		the link (Figure \ref{figure: link system call}). Links and files
		may be destroyed through the \texttt{unlink()} system call.

		% File system system calls: file permissions.
		Every file has a owner user and a 9-bit flag assigned to it. These
		flags state what are the read, write and execution permissions for
		the file, for the owner user, the owner's group users and all
		others. If a program wants to perform any of these operations it
		must have enough permissions to do so. The file ownership and
		permissions may be changed through the \texttt{chown()} and
		\texttt{chmod()} system calls, respectively, and users can query
		these information by calling \texttt{stat()}.

				\caption{After.}

		\end{figure}

		% Process management system calls: dealing with processes.
		Processes are abstraction of running programs and play a central
		role in Nanvix. Programs may create new processes by calling
		\texttt{fork()}, which creates an exact copy of the current running
		process. The primal process is called the parent and the new process
		is called child, and they have the same code, variables, opened
		files, and execution flow, differing only differ in their ID number.
		Processes may query about their ID by calling \texttt{getpid()} and
		may change their core through the \texttt{execve()} system call.
		When the process is done, it invokes \texttt{exit()} to relinquish
		all resources that it was using.

		% Process management system calls: signals and synchronization.
		Processes may synchronize their activities using two approaches:
		through signals or synchronization primitives. In the former, the
		intend recipient process A first registers a callback function that
		will handle some specific signal, by calling \texttt{signal()}. If
		the process has nothing more to do than waiting for a signal to
		arrive, it may invoke \texttt{pause()} to block until such event
		happens. Later, another process may send a signal to A by calling
		\texttt{kill()}, therefore triggering the handler function in A. In
		the second approach, two processes may open a pipe, a dedicate
		communication channel, and effectively exchange data with one
		another. A process in one end of the pipe writes data to it, and in
		the other end a second processes reads data from the pipe, with all
		the required producer-consumer synchronization being transparently
		handled by the kernel.

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}
\label{section: hardware requirements}

	% Target architecture.
	Nanvix has been primarily designed to target the \texttt{x86}
	architecture. Nevertheless, thanks to the hardware abstraction layer, it
	may be easily ported to other platforms. Still, the new platform shall
	meet some requirements to enable this smooth transition.

	% Paging.
	First, paging shall be somehow supported, since the memory
	management subsystem relies on this feature to enable virtual
	memory. Additionally, the hardware shall provide a protection
	mechanism that would point out whether a page fault has been caused
	due to a missing page or to a permission violation. Nanvix uses this
	information to easy the creation of new processes through the
	copy-on-write and demand paging techniques.

	% Interrupts
	Second, the hardware shall support interrupts. Nanvix is a
	preemptive system, and the hardware shall provide some clock device
	that generates interrupts at regular time intervals. The scheduler
	completely relies on this feature, and the system would not even
	boot without it. Additionally, the hardware should also offer a
	mechanism to enable and disable interrupts. The kernel uses this
	mechanism to achieve exclusion on critical regions, and thus avoid
	race conditions in kernel land (chaos).
